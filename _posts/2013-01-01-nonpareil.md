Nonpareil measures read redundancy using different heuristics and (optionally)
exact *k*-mer comparisons to estimate the abundance-weighted average coverage
of a metagenome as well as its sequence diversity (*N<sub>d</sub>*).

The [original publication of Nonpareil](/publication/nonpareil-coverage)
described the base algorithm as well as the statistical basis for coverage
estimation based on redundancy. The *k*-mer kernel and the diversity index are
described in the [Nonpareil 3 manuscript](/publication/nonpareil-3). Additional
biological and statistical context as well as practical relevance are
[discussed in a commentary about coverage](/publication/coverage-matters).
