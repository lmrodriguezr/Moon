## Abstract
The ubiquitous alpha-proteobacteria of the order “*Candidatus* Pelagibacterales”
(SAR11) are highly abundant in aquatic environments, and among them, members of
the monophyletic lineage LD12 (also known as SAR11 clade IIIb) are specifically
found in lacustrine ecosystems.
Clade IIIb bacteria are some of the most prominent members of freshwater
environments, but little is known about their biology due to the lack of genome
representatives.
Only recently, the first non-marine isolate was cultured and described as
“*Candidatus* Fonsibacter ubiquis”.
Here, we expand the collection of freshwater IIIb representatives and describe
a new IIIb species of the genus “*Ca.* Fonsibacter”.
Specifically, we assembled a collection of 67 freshwater metagenomic datasets
from the interconnected lakes of the Chattahoochee River basin (GA, USA) and
obtained nearly complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 5
distinct IIIb subclades, roughly equivalent to species based on genomic
standards, including the previously described “*Ca.* F. ubiquis”.
Genomic comparisons between members of the IIIb species revealed high
similarity in gene content.
However, when comparing their abundance profiles in the Chattahoochee basin and
various aquatic environments, differences in temporal and spatial distributions
among the distinct species were observed implying niche differentiation might
be underlying the coexistence of the highly functionally similar
representatives.
The name *Ca.* Fonsibacter lacus *sp. nov.* is proposed for the most abundant
and widespread species in the Chattahoochee River basin and various freshwater
ecosystems.
