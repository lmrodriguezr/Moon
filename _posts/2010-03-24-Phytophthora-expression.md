## Background
*Phytophthora infestans* (Mont.) de Bary causes late blight of potato and tomato, and has a broad host range within the Solanaceae family. Most studies of the *Phytophthora* – *Solanum* pathosystem have focused on gene expression in the host and have not analyzed pathogen gene expression *in planta*.

## Methodology/Principal Findings
We describe in detail an *in silico* approach to mine ESTs from inoculated host plants deposited in a database in order to identify particular pathogen sequences associated with disease. We identified candidate effector genes through mining of 22,795 ESTs corresponding to *P. infestans* cDNA libraries in compatible and incompatible interactions with hosts from the Solanaceae family.

## Conclusions/Significance
We annotated genes of *P. infestans* expressed *in planta* associated with late blight using different approaches and assigned putative functions to 373 out of the 501 sequences found in the *P. infestans* genome draft, including putative secreted proteins, domains associated with pathogenicity and poorly characterized proteins ideal for further experimental studies. Our study provides a methodology for analyzing cDNA libraries and provides an understanding of the plant – oomycete pathosystems that is independent of the host, condition, or type of sample by identifying genes of the pathogen expressed *in planta*.
