## Abstract
This book chapter attempts to summarize the major findings from genome-based
taxonomic studies in the past two decades, and briefly describe the major
genome-based approaches currently available for species identification and
classification with special focus on the 'uncultivated majority' and associated
limitations, as well as outlines future directions towards a truly genome-based
taxonomy for prokaryotes that will equally encompass cultured and uncultivated
taxa.
Importantly, the need for a system to catalogue uncultivated taxa is very
urgent, because the genomes and ecological/functional data that are becoming
available are already overwhelming, and alphanumeric identifiers and synonyms
are creating confusion of Babylonian dimensions.
