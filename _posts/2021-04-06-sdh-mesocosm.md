## Abstract

The specialization-disturbance hypothesis predicts that, in the event of a
disturbance, generalists are favored, while specialists are selected against.
This hypothesis has not been rigorously tested in microbial systems and it
remains unclear to what extent it could explain microbial community succession
patterns following perturbations. Previous field observations of Pensacola Beach
sands that were impacted by the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill provided
evidence in support of the specialization-disturbance hypothesis.
However, ecological drift as well as uncounted environmental fluctuations
(*e.g.*, storms) could not be ruled out as confounding factors driving these
field results. In this study, the specialization-disturbance hypothesis was
tested on beach sands, disturbed by DWH crude oil, ex situ in closed laboratory
advective-flow chambers that mimic in situ conditions in saturated beach
sediments.
The chambers were inoculated with weathered DWH oil and unamended chambers
served as controls.
The time series of shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence data
from a two-month long incubation showed that functional diversity significantly
increased while taxonomic diversity significantly declined, indicating a
decrease in specialist taxa. Thus, results from this laboratory study
corroborate field observations, providing verification that the
specialization-disturbance hypothesis can explain microbial succession patterns
in crude oil impacted beach sands.
