## Abstract

Genomic and metagenomic analyses are increasingly becoming commonplace in several areas of biological research, but recurrent specialized analyses are frequently reported as in-house scripts rarely available after publication. We describe the enveomics collection, a growing set of actively maintained scripts for several recurrent and specialized tasks in microbial genomics and metagenomics, and present a graphical user interface and several case studies. Our resource includes previously described as well as new algorithms such as Transformed-space Resampling In Biased Sets (TRIBS), a novel method to evaluate phylogenetic under- or over-dispersion in reference sets with strong phylogenetic bias. The enveomics collection is freely available under the terms of the Artistic License 2.0 at [https://github.com/lmrodriguezr/enveomics](https://github.com/lmrodriguezr/enveomics) and for online analysis at [http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu](http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu).
